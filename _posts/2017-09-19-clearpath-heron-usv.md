# Heron USV

Heron is a portable, mid-sized surface vessel. The catamaran design includes anti-fouling thrusters, an incredibly shallow profile, and built in GPS for easy access positioning data. This unmanned surface vessel features a payload bay for mounting submerged sensors or equipment on deck. Heronâ€™s folding pontoons and quick swappable battery make transport, launch and retrieval a quick and easy process.
