RB-1 is an autonomous and configurable robot, focused on the field of research in indoor applications.

The manipulator base can be mounted with a wide range of lasers which have 5 to 30-60 meters operational range. Depending on the model, the view goes from 240ยบ to 270ยบ.

The software of the robot includes a control system, a tracking system (laser-based) and a navigation system, as well as a HMI user interface for diagnostics and remote control.
