The Omron Adept MobileRobots Seekur is a large general purpose
holonomic mobile robot platform capable of omnidirectional movement
and both indoor and outdoor use.
Seekur includes a motion controller that implements omnidirectional vehicle
velocity control and position integration, and options include one or more 
internal onboard computers, laser sensor, GPS, autonomous navigation 
software (using both laser and GPS sensor), and more.

The Seekur can be used in ROS using the "rosaria", "rosarnl", or "p2os" drivers,
and model and launch configuration is available. Visit
