introduction: Co-developed by NVIDIA and the robotics department at California Polytechnic State University, ‘Jet’ is a smart, autonomous robot based on the NVIDIA Jetson embedded development platform utilizing Servocity Acotobotics components. Jet’s brain is built around the NVIDIA Tegra SoC and uses the same NVIDIA computing cores designed into supercomputers. This gives Jet compute-intensive computer vision, artificial intelligence (AI), and self-driving capabilities in a low-cost package.

#### 'Jet' Hardware

Purchase the complete ‘Jet’ Robot Kit – which includes either Jetson [TX1](https://www.servocity.com/tx1-jet-robot-kit) or the Jetson [TK1](https://www.servocity.com/tk1-jet-robot-kit) - directly from Servocity.

The complete TX1 'Jet' Robot Kit can be purchased [here](https://www.servocity.com/tx1-jet-robot-kit).

The complete TK1 'Jet' Robot Kit can be purchased [here](https://www.servocity.com/tk1-jet-robot-kit). 

#### 'Jet' Software

Jet utilizes the Robot Operating System (ROS) for abstraction, scaling from K-12 projects to real industrial applications.

The downloadable ['Jet' Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/jet-robot) contains build instructions, example code, and educational materials covering:

* Introduction to Robotics, 'Jet', and Robot Operating System (ROS)
* Sensors and Actuators
* Obstacle detection and avoidance using sonar
* Image processing and edge detection using blurs, Canny Edge Detection, and Hough Lines Transform
* GPU-accelerated HAAR Cascade Classifiers for facial detection

The 'Jet' Toolkit can be downloaded [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/jet-robot).

#### Robotics Teaching Kit with 'Jet'

NVIDIA and CalPoly University have collaborated to bring educators the [Robotics Teaching Kit with ‘Jet’](https://developer.nvidia.com/teaching-kits). This free teaching kit contains everything needed to teach a full-term course covering introductory and advanced robotics concepts such as sensors, computer vision, machine learning, robot localization, and control. The Robotics Teaching Kit with ‘Jet’ is available to **qualified instructors** and includes lecture slides, hands-on labs/solutions, quiz/exam problem sets/solutions, larger coding project ideas, build plans, and source code for the Robot Operating System (ROS) using Jetson.

Educators can request the Robotics Teaching Kit with 'Jet' [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/teaching-kits).
