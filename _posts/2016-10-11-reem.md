REEM, the humanoid service robot created by PAL Robotics, can be used for several purposes. Thanks to its autonomous navigation system, its user-friendly touchscreen, and its voice and face recognition system, REEM can find its way in various surroundings and help or entertain people in most public environments.

Besides helping you as a guide or amusing you as an entertainer, REEM can also transport small packages, and its dynamic information point can be used with a wide variety of multimedia applications: display an interactive map of the surrounding area, call up a variety of information (weather, nearby restaurants, airlines travel time, etc...), offer tele-assistance via video-conferencing.

More information can be found in the [PAL Robotics](http://pal-robotics.com) website.
