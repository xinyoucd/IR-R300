SUMMIT-X is a dual configuration mobile platform designed mainly for indoor tasks, although it also can work outdoor. SUMMIT-X robot can be raised to a considerable height (such a table, for example). The scissor mechanism of the mobile robot, has also the ability to lower its CDG allowing it to reach speeds up to 3m/s.

It has omnidirectional or skid-steering kinematics based on 4 high-power motor wheels. Each wheel integrates a hub brushless motor with gearbox, speed sensors and optional encoder.
