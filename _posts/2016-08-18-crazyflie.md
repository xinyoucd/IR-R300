Crazyflie is an open-source and open-hardware nano quadcopter made by [Bitcraze](https://www.bitcraze.io). 
There are two models available: [Crazyflie 1](https://wiki.bitcraze.io/projects:crazyflie:index) is the older discontinued version, weighing just 19g. 
[Crazyflie 2.0](https://wiki.bitcraze.io/projects:crazyflie2:index) is the current model with more features but slightly heavier (27g).

Both are supported by ROS and can be controlled from a host computer using a special USB dongle called [Crazyradio](https://wiki.bitcraze.io/projects:crazyradio:index).
