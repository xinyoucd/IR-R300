The PR2 is a mobile manipulation platform built by Willow Garage. The PR2 software system is written entirely in ROS. As such, all PR2 capabilities are available via ROS interfaces.

If you are using a PR2, we recommend starting with the [PR2 User Manual](http://pr2s.clearpathrobotics.com/wiki/PR2%20Manual). The information below is provided for those wishing to use the PR2 software system as a model for other robots.


Clearpath Robotics now supports the PR2's software and infrastructure! Visit <http://www.clearpathrobotics.com/pr2/> for more info.
