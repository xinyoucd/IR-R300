[Erle-Plane](http://erlerobotics.com/blog/erle-plane/) is a fixed-wing drone based on the award winner [APM:Plane](http://plane.ardupilot.com/) platform. Our hardware autopilot, [Erle-brain](Robots/Erle-brain), uses the APM autopilot thereby it can run missions following a list of recorded GPS waypoints.

Compared to other aerial robots such as [Erle-Copter](Robots/Erle-copter), [Erle-Plane](http://erlerobotics.com/blog/erle-plane/) is ideal for missions that require more autonomy (time-wise) and where a big terrain must be covered.

[Erle-Plane](http://erlerobotics.com/blog/erle-plane/) is powered by a Linux autopilot which includes ROS and communicates with the flight software using the [[mavros]] ROS package.
