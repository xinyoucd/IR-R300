# CoroWare CoroBot

CoroBot is a capable, expandable and affordable mobile robot platform designed to minimize the complexity of robot development.
The unit comes fully assembled and tested with your choice of operating systems pre-installed.
Because CoroBot is assembled with real hardware, as opposed to plastic clips, it is fully modifiable and expandable.
