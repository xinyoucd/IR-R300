Nao is a commercially available humanoid robot built by [Aldebaran](http://www.aldebaran.com/). The ROS driver was originally developed by Freiburg's [Humanoid Robots Lab](http://hrl.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/) and [Armin Hornung](http://www.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~hornunga/). It essentially wraps the needed parts of Aldebaran's NaoQI API (versions 1.14 and 2.1) and makes it available in ROS. It also provides a complete robot model (URDF).
