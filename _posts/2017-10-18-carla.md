The Udacity self-driving car was developed in collaboration with AutonomousStuff and Autoware to serve as the hardware platform for Udacity's Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree. Students from around the world have built controls and perception software to run on the vehicle. It was also used to evaluate submissions to Udacity's open source challenges that focused on areas like image based localization. One of the major milestones for the vehicle was driving full autonomously from Mountain View to San Francisco. This required it to localize to a pre-mapped area with LIDAR, detect other vehicles and pedestrians using LIDAR/camera fusion, and accurately classify traffic light state.
